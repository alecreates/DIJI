This is DIJI! 

DIJI is a short, 8-bit game created using Python's pygame library that generates random paths towards several target objects. The main objective of the game is to collect all targets using the most efficient route based on the user's order of collection. In the background, "Diji" will be running Dikjstra's algorithm to compare the algorithm's optimal path in pixels to the player's path. The final score is calculated as a percentage, and the player can choose to play again as many times as they would like in order to beat their own record.

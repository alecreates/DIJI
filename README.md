## About Diji

This is Diji! 

Diji is a short game created using Python's pygame library that generates random paths towards several target objects. The main objective of the game is to collect all targets using the most efficient route based on the user's order of collection. The paths are stored in a graph as vertices and edges after the random generation. In the background, "Diji" will be running Dikjstra's algorithm to compare the algorithm's optimal path in pixels to the player's path. The final score is calculated as a percentage.

> [!NOTE] 
> this game is not meant to be challenging and is meant to display Dikjstra's capabilities in a game-like context.
